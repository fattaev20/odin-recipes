    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>
        If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.

        <p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes            </p>
            </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).            
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.            
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.            
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>
                Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.            
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).            
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>
                Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.            
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>
